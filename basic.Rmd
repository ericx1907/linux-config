Below is a code chunk:

```{r, plot-slope}
fit = lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
b   = coef(fit)
plot(cars)
abline(fit)
```

The slope of the regression is `r b[1]`.

## Some math
$$\begin{equation} \label{eq1}
\begin{split}
A & = \frac{\pi r^2}{2} \\
  & = \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2
\end{split}
\end{equation}$$

In R, the character
\# indicates a comment.

```{python}
import sys
import time
print(sys.version)
t = time.localtime()
current_time = time.strftime("%H:%M:%S", t)
print(current_time)
x = 'hello, python world! wow this is amazing'
print(x.split(' '))
```
