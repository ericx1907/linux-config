Below is a code chunk:

```{r, plot-slope}
fit = lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
b   = coef(fit)
plot(cars)
abline(fit)
```

The slope of the regression is `r b[1]`.

## Some math
$$\begin{equation} \label{eq1}
\begin{split}
A & = \frac{\pi r^2}{2} \\
  & = \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2
\end{split}
\end{equation}$$

In R, the character
\# indicates a comment.
